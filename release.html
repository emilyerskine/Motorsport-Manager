                <p>Motorsport Manager was originally released on mobile for iOS on 21 August 2014. 
                Following considerable success both critically and commercially upon release, 
                the game was released on Android in 2015. 
                The subsequent macOS, Microsoft Windows and Linux desktop versions were published by Sega, 
                following their financial backing of developer Playsport Games, 
                and were released on 9 November 2016 and 23 November 2016 respectively. 
                The desktop versions of the game significantly expanded upon the gameplay mechanics of the mobile version, 
                alleviating the previous hardware constraints put forward by mobile devices, which allowed for a more 
                in-depth gameplay experience with enhanced graphical fidelity, relative to mobile versions of the game.<br><br>

                The version for Nintendo Switch was released on March 14, 2019. In the Switch version, 
                which is the console debut for the series, you can build a team with three car classes 
                and compete in nine tiers of racing.</p>
