        <h1>Mobile Version</h1>
        <p>The iOS version of Motorsport Manager received positive reviews from critics.
            
            J. D. Cohen of TouchArcade awarded the game a score of 4.5 out of 5, writing: "It's never overwhelming, nor is it too light to maintain interest. Motorsport Manager finds a nice spot in the complexity spectrum wherein it requires frequent decision-making, without ever inducing paralysis by presenting too many options simultaneously."
            
            Pocket Gamer's Harry Slater writes: "This is the ice cold nature of Motorsport Manager. One second you can be flying high in first place, the next your tyres fail you and you slip back to fifth, cursing as you do. (...) Things do get a little repetitive, but there's a huge game to work your way through here, and if it gets its claws into you it's unlikely to let go for a good long while. Motorsport Manager manages to walk the line between number-juggling sims and the softer end of the spectrum, and in doing so creates a strategy game that almost anyone can have a crack at." The website awarded a score of 9/10. The game sold over 1.6 million copies on both iOS and Android.
            
            Pocket Gamer gave Motorsport Manager Mobile 3, released in July 2018, a 4.5/5 score and a positive review, saying the changes between 2 and 3 were significant. In February 2020, Tech Radar named Motorsport Manager Mobile 3 one of the best Android games of the year. The publication called it "a big leap on from the relatively simplistic original Motorsport Manager Mobile. "Motorsport Manager 3 was also given a positive review by Kotaku, saying the presentation was interesting and easy to navigate. While Vice praised gameplay, it did say the game made it too easy to succeed, saying "without that risk frustration, that little taste of sacrifice and the threat of encroaching despair, it's never feels quite like racing. "Top Gear called MMM3 "streamlined and intuitive." The review also called it "far less involved game than the PC version of Motorsport Manager, better suited to bus rides, train journeys and studiously ignoring your family by the pool on holiday."</p>

        <h3>Pre-release</h3>
        <p> Websites that early-tested the game gave it very positive reviews.
            
            In May 2016, PC Gamer's Sean Clever wrote: "It's a niche subgenre, and one I didn't expect to see outside of an FIA licence, but this seems like a decent first effort to put racing management games back on the grid."
            
            In August 2016, IGN's Luke Reilly stated: "It-s an incredibly nuanced experience and, while it's initially rather intimidating, Motorsport Manager has successfully got its tentacles around me after several sessions with an early version of the game. (...) I also like the pressure of race day and the genuinely stressful situations that can arise."</p>

        <h3>Post-release</h3>
        <p>The game received positive reviews after release. Eurogamer.net's Martin Robinson reports the lack of the ability to save or copy racing set-ups, and writes: "Such an approachable veneer disguises an otherwise complex, sometimes cruel and a little too often abstruse experience. Managing the strategies of two cars - and micromanaging each driver to boot - can prove to be a taxing task, and while it's satisfying to execute the perfect strategy there aren't quite enough tools at your disposal to balance out the frustration that often accompanies raceday. The feedback you're given by drivers is a little too obscure, the ability to read lap times and deltas a little too sparse to make chasing the perfect set-up anything other than a dark art. (...) Motorsport Manager's a couple of tweaks away from greatness, then, but it's far from a disappointment."
            
            On GameStar, Benjamin Danneberg says: "Motorsport Manager is not a hardcore management game, where I have to put every screw correctly. Instead, the game is a healthy way of strategy and fun."
            
            Motorsport.com's Valentin Khorounzhiy writes: "Motorsport Manager is a great game on its own merit and a roaring success for a subgenre that seems to be waking up from a long hiatus. Its price tag may seem steep to some, but it's got enough content and variety to justify it. (...) There's potential for improvement, yes, but Playsport has done an admirable job with the first installment - and it will hopefully move enough copies to justify many, many follow-ups."
            
            James Swinbanks of PC PowerPlay writes: "There is always something going on behind the scenes in Motorsport Manager, and it always adds to the experience. I never felt cheated, even when things didn't go my way. (...) It's not perfect; a few setup quirks, like increasing rear wing angle adding understeer, don't make any sense and had me scratching my head trying to work out why they might design it that way. But in the grand scheme of things, Motorsport Manager does what I want it to do. It puts me on the pit wall, in the thick of it." The website gave a score of 8/10.
            
            DSport Magazine gave the first PC version a positive response in its review, noting the level of micromanaging was scalable depending on how intensive the player wanted the strategizing to be.</p>

        <h1>Nintendo Switch</h1>
        <p>In March 2019, Pocket Gamer positively gave a review about the port of Motorsport Manager 3 to Switch. It said, positively, that the gameplay was similar to the mobile version. It described a more complicated control scheme allowed through hotkeys on controllers, and the ability to see tiny models of cars instead of dots on the maps.</p>
